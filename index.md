# Ali Vaziri

Hi, I’m Ali, interested in research that connects data-driven modeling, optimization, and autonomous systems. I focus on building scalable algorithms for robotics and dynamical systems, where I’ve tackled challenges in collective behavior and wireless networks. In my previous work, I combined deep learning with control theory and signal processing to capture complex interactions and design more efficient autonomous systems. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Azad University, Tehran branch, and then I moved to New Jersey to continue my studies. I graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology with an M.Sc. in Software Engineering from the Department of Systems Engineering. After that, I joined Rutgers University - New Brunswick as a master's student in the Department of Statistics to improve and recreate my knowledge in Mathematics and Statistics to help further research during my PhD program.
