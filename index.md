# Ali Vaziri

I am a Master’s student in Software Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology (expected May 2025). My interests include applying artificial intelligence in healthcare, exploring brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and advanced signal processing techniques, and developing useful software systems that solve real-world problems.
