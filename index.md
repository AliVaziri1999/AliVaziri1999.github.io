# Ali Vaziri

Hi, I’m Ali, a software engineer with a keen interest in research aimed at developing intelligent systems that connect data with real-world applications. I earned my Master’s degree in Software Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology (2023–2025) and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Azad University, Tehran (2017–2022). My research concentrates on optimization and AI-driven signal processing, particularly within intricate engineering and computational systems. I am especially focused on leveraging AI techniques to improve signal analysis, enhance decision-making, and optimize engineering systems.
